Thoth (𓅝 ḏḥwtj)

This software transforms the norm definitions of the Secure Software Development (SSD) standard
by the Center for Information security and Privacy protection (CIP) into a readable form.

Thoth is the god of the Moon, wisdom, knowledge, writing, hieroglyphs, science, magic, art and
judgement. As such he plays a major role to maintain Ma'at, the proper order in the world and
the universe.

As CIP's SSD aims to create some order in software development it only seems right to name the
software that makes the norms of SSD readable after this deity.

The Thoth software can be found at https://github.com/CIP-HUB/Thoth.
You will also find some documentation and an example norm definition there.
