# Thoth (𓅝, ḏḥwtj)

[Thoth][Thoth-wikipedia] (𓅝, ḏḥwtj; Djehuti) is the old Egyptian god of the Moon, wisdom,
knowledge, writing, hieroglyphs, science, magic, art and judgement. As such he plays a major
role to maintain Ma'at, the proper order in the world and the universe.

This software aims to comprehensively capture structured knowledge,
to allow information to be created and maintained with tools,
and bring some order into what would otherwise be a pile of forms on a desk
or in digital storage.
It thus seems quite fitting to name the software after this deity.

The [manual](./docs/MANUAL.md) should be sufficient to get you started.

The __Thoth__ software can be found at [github][Thoth-github].
You will also find some documentation and an example norm definition there.
