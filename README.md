# Thoth (𓅝, ḏḥwtj)

This software is used to create, maintain and render the norm definitions
of Secure Software Development (SSD) method of the
[Center for Information security and Privacy protection (CIP)][CIP-website].

[Thoth][Thoth-wikipedia] is the god of the Moon,
wisdom, knowledge, writing, hieroglyphs, science, magic, art and
judgement. As such he plays a major role to maintain Ma'at, the
proper order in the world and the universe.

As CIP's SSD aims to create some order in software development it only seems
right to name the software that makes the norms of SSD readable after this deity.

The __Thoth__ software can be found at [github][Thoth-github].
You will also find some documentation and an example norm definition there.
